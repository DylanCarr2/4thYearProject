Hi, this project is a web scraping web-app built in Python that hosts a web-site that the user inputs a query into a search box. Results from 2 different marketplace sites, adverts.ie, and donedeal.ie, are then displayed on a web page.

To run the software, you must clone this repository, navigate to it in a CLI, then install the dependencies using the following commands:
pip install requests
pip install flask
pip install beautifulsoup4
If "pip install" does not work, you must install Python.

After this is done, launch the script with "python scraper.py", then navigate to the address specified in the terminal.
